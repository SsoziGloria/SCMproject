## About this project

Chocolate Supply Chain Management System

This project is a class assignment to design and build a system that manages the full supply chain of chocolate — from raw cocoa beans to finished products on store shelves.

The system helps different users track inventory, place and manage orders, chat across the chain, and generate useful reports. It also uses machine learning to:
•	Predict future demand for chocolate.
•	Group customers by their buying behavior for better service.

The system is built using Laravel (for the backend and interface), MySQL (for the database), Python (for machine learning), and Java (for vendor validation through uploaded PDF applications).

This GitHub repository supports our 7-week collaborative development process and will track team progress and contributions.
